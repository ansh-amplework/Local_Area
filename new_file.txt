Deep generative learning is deep learning that focuses on creating new output from learned input. 
Traditionally, deep learning focused on identifying relationships between data. Deep learning models 
were trained with large amounts of data to recognize patterns in the data set.

Deep generative learning adds generation to pattern recognition.
 Such models look for data patterns and then create their own unique patterns. 
 For example, they can analyze the text in several books and then use the information to generate new sentences and 
 paragraphs not found in the original books.
